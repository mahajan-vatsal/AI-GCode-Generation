\chapter{Future Scope}

While the project achieved a functional and well-integrated system, there are possibilities for further developments as mentioned below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Extend the workflow to include direct image capture from a Raspberry Pi camera, allowing business cards to be scanned and processed automatically. The captured image could be sent directly into the systemâ€™s input folder, triggering the pipeline and automating G-code generation with minimal human intervention.
	\item Develop a dynamic GUI for displaying and editing the extracted data, allowing users to directly interact with text, logos, and layout elements. Such an interface would improve usability and provide greater flexibility compared to the current command-based approach.
	\item Integrate a drag-and-drop mechanism into the editing process, enabling users to reposition or resize elements intuitively. This would complement the existing natural-language editing feature and broaden accessibility for users without technical expertise.
	\item Develop a dedicated logo vectorisation agent using deep learning models (e.g., convolutional autoencoders or diffusion-based tracers) to accurately reproduce logos not present in the database.
